## This is the codebase for the agora android app.

I have used Native Java for development.
Currently i have used firebase authentication for registration and login but later on we will move to rest APIâ€™s. 

Also, the data in the application is all dummy and certain features like adding candidates in creating election, choosing algorithm are all hard coded and not functional. This prototype is made to demonstrate the UI aspect of every screen and basic functionalities like Login, Signup etc.

The link for the video of the whole flow of the prototype on a live android design is given below:

## Mockups For Android Development under Project Agora Web
I have created mockups regarding Issue #91


I have tried to keep the UI pretty simple yet very user friendly and tried to use maximum material design guidelines.The theme colours are choosed keeping in mind Agora Web Colours and even tried to incorporate your feedback on other requests as well.


Hoping to get the feedback from all the mentors and other people.


###### Splash Screen

Wen the app is opened this will be introductory splash screen with logo spinning in circular motion. It will check wether the user is signed in or not and will redirect to login page or dashboard page accordingly.

Once the registration is done a verification email will be sent to the user. We can use firebase auth for that.

On clicking on any of the card the corresponding elections page will be opened with data filtered according to the option clicked.
